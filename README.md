# gimp-scripts
Some useful scripts for Gimp allowing to control visibility of layers. I use it to flip layers when I create simple pixel art animations.

# Install
To install the scripts you need to copy the `.scm` files to your Gimp scripts directory. Under Ubuntu with Gimp 2.8, it is in `/home/{user}/.gimp-2.8/scripts`.
